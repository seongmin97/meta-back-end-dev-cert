    - information 100+
    - successful 200+
    - redirection 300+
    - client error 400+
    - server error 500+
- HTTPS, secure version of HTTP.
  - request turned into a secret code
  - only the other computer can turn it back to original content
- website, web application, web pages
  - web pages at a particular domain make up a website, 
  - and that the key difference between websites, and web applications is the level of interactivity, and dynamic content.
