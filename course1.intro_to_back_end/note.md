## Get started with web development 

- front-end techs
  - **HTML** structures the content you see

- TCP and UDP

- HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
  - method: get, post, put delete		
  - path
  - version
  - headers
  - response status code 
    - information 100+
    - successful 200+
    - redirection 300+
    - client error 400+
    - server error 500+
- HTTPS, secure version of HTTP.
  - request turned into a secret code
  - only the other computer can turn it back to original content
- website, web application, web pages
  - web pages at a particular domain make up a website, 
  - and that the key difference between websites, and web applications is the level of interactivity, and dynamic content. 

- Framework: provide the structure to developer to build with. e.g. Django, ASP.NET
- Libraries: reusable code, specific function.
- RESTful apis: representational state transfer, is a set of principles that help build highly efficient API's. 
- backend roles: database, cloud servers
