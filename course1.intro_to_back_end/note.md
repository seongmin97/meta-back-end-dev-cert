## Get started with web development 

- front-end techs
  - **HTML** structures the content you see
  - **CSS** controls the colors and style 
  - **JavaScript** is responsible for the user interaction.
  - e..g. realtime clock time: clock.html, styles.css, clock.js


- TCP and UDP

- HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
  - method: get, post, put delete		
  - path
  - version
  - headers
  - response status code 
    - information 100+
    - successful 200+
    - redirection 300+
    - client error 400+
    - server error 500+
- HTTPS, secure version of HTTP.
  - request turned into a secret code
  - only the other computer can turn it back to original content
- website, web application, web pages
  - web pages at a particular domain make up a website, 
  - and that the key difference between websites, and web applications is the level of interactivity, and dynamic content. 

- Framework: provide the structure to developer to build with. e.g. Django, ASP.NET
- Libraries: reusable code, specific function.
- RESTful apis: representational state transfer, is a set of principles that help build highly efficient API's. 
- backend roles: database, cloud servers

## Introduction to HTML5 and CSS  

- html tags
  - `<head></head>`
  - hyberlink: `<a href="location.html">Our location</a>`

- form 
- DOM
  - document objects model. JS code can query and update it.
- html elements: [ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements)

- selecting and styling: css
  - selector
    - elements
    - ID   `#`
    - class  `.`
    - element with class selector
    - descendant selectors
    - child selector
  - declaration block
- Box model
  - content
  - padding
  - border
  - margin
- css [ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)



## UI Frameworks

- Responsive design is a set of three practices that allows a website to automatically change its visuals.
  - Flexible grids
  - Fluid images
  - Media queries: Orientation, Display size, Aspect ratio
- breakpoint
  - fix grid
  - fluid grid
  - hybrid grid
- **Bootstrap** is a collection of pre-written code chunks in CSS and JavaScript that allows you to create websites more quickly than if you had to create every bit of code from scratch.
  - document [ref](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/?)
- Static and Dynamic
  - static: such as image and video.
  - dynamic: generated when http requests is made.
- Single page applicaiton: only one HTML page. It has two approaches to serving code and resources
  - bundling, server retures and loads all necessary HTML, CSS and JS immeiately.
  - lazy loading, return minimum resources needed to load the application
- React: write less coe to create functionality
  - React builds a representation of the browser Document Object Model or DOM in memory called the virtual DOM
  - React check virtual DOM first, if a change is required, the browswer DOM is updated as needed.
- Component hierarchy
